My name is Anne Grete Carlsen and Iâ€™m the woman behind the Gang at Agapi Doodles.
I have been breeding Australian Labradoodles for more than a decade and I love raising puppies and see the joy when my families are ready to bring home their new 4 paws family member. I make an effort to keep up to date in my field and as being a trained midwife in my former career I do have a lot of knowledge and experience in pregnancy, birth and neonatal care which gives me a good base to assist my dogs when they are giving birth and taking care of the newborns.

My interest is to raise sound and healthy and happy puppies, who have the best start in life and are well socialized and stimulated - loved and cared for in every way.

I also take interest in serving healthy diets, avoid overvaccination and stay away from chemical/pesticides.
